# NeatVideoFloatingLicense
Python script to automatically create a Neat Video license file as you would with setting environment variables.
This will create the license file so the user won't have to set any servers and ports themselves.

## Usage
```
import neatvideo_license

neatvideo_license.NeatVideoFloatingLicense(license_server="SERVER", port=PORT)
```
